 ### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

 ## My process

 My intial process begin with a mock up design for the site created in Figma. I wanted something simple and took inspiration from local print chicken resturant ads.

I wanted to design the layout of the site with a "mobile first" mentality and tried to begin the coding process by creating the mobile version of the site first.

### What I learned
During the course of the project I learned several techniques around using flexbox to create containers that can expand and collaspe when activated. I also played around with CSS animations, mostly transitions, and how to manipulate selectors in css. 



### Going Foward
The challenges I faced during this project mainly involved the Footer section. I had difficulty keeping it at the bottom of the viewport at various screen sizes, and I ultimately came to the conclusion that I need more experience with CSS layout and responsive design.
